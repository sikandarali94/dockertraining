  # The downside to this approach for running our tests in a service is that we are getting all the output from our test
  # suite inside of the logging interface of Docker Compose. And we do not have the ability to enter any Standard Input
  # / Output to this service container e.g. we can't hit enter to get the test suite to rerun.
